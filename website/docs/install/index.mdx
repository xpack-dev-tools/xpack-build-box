# How to install the xPack Build Box


## Prerequisites

A recent [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (>=**18.0.0**),
since the TypeScript code
is compiled into ECMAScript 2020 code, and the tests use ES6 modules.

## Install

The package is available as
[`xpack-build-box`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xpack-build-box/)
from the public [`npmjs`](https://www.npmjs.com) repository;
it can be added as a
dependency to any TypeScript or JavaScript
project with `npm install`:

```console
npm install xpack-build-box@latest --save-dev
```


The package does not provide any executables, and generally there are no
reasons to install it globally.

## Uninstall

As any **npm** package, it can be uninstalled from the project with:

```console
npm uninstall xpack-build-box
```
