# How to contribute to  the xPack Build Box

This page is designed for developers who plan to contribute new features
or fix bugs in the
**xPack Build Box**
project and provides documentation on how to build and test the package.



<Prerequisites nodeVersion="18.0.0" nodeVersionMajor="18"/>

<GetProjectSources />

:::tip

To contribute Pull Requests, fork the project and be sure the **Copy the master branch only** is **disabled**.

Use the `xpack-development` branch and be sure you contribute the
Pull Requests back to the `xpack-development` branch.

## Satisfy dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

## Add links for development

To facilitate the use of this module in other packages, add a link
from the central npm storage to this local development folder:

```sh
npm link
```

And in the projects referring it:

```sh
npm link xpack-build-box
```

## Start the compile background task

The TypeScript compiler can automatically recompile modified files. For
this, start it in `watch` mode.

```sh
npm run compile-watch
```
## Language standard compliance


TBD


## Standard style


TBD


Generally, to fit two editor windows side by side in a screen,
all files should limit the line length to 80.

```js
/* eslint max-len: [ "error", 80, { "ignoreUrls": true } ] */
```

Known and accepted exceptions:

<StyleExceptions />

To manually fix compliance with the style guide (where possible):

<CodeBlock language="console"> {
`% npm run fix

> xpack-build-box@${customField('releaseVersion')} fix
> standard --fix test
...
`} </CodeBlock>

## Documentation metadata


TBD


## Tests

The tests use the [`node-tap`](http://www.node-tap.org) framework
(_A Test-Anything-Protocol library for Node.js_, written by Isaac Schlueter).

Tests can be written in TypeScript, assuming `ts-node` is also installed.

As for any `npm` package, the standard way to run the project tests is via
`npm run test`:

```sh
npm install
npm run test
```

### Continuous Integration (CI)

The module is 
CI tested on every push via
[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/xpack-build-box/actions), on Ubuntu,
Windows and macOS, using node 18, 20 and 22.
