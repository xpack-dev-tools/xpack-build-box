### v3.0

The v3.0 release was the first production ready solution. It used very large
custom Docker images for GNU/Linux and folders with compiled tools
for macOS.

### v5.0.0

The v5.0.0 is the first self-sustained release,
which allows to build new binary xpm packages using previous package releases,
without requiring any custom Docker images, or other compiled tools
