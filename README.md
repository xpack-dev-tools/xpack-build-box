# XBB (xPack Build Box)

The [xPack Build Box](https://xpack.github.io/xbb/)
is an elaborated build environment focused on
obtaining reproducible builds while creating cross-platform standalone
binaries for GNU/Linux, macOS and Windows.

## Overview

This open source project is hosted on GitHub as
[`xpack/xpack-build-box`](https://github.com/xpack/xpack-build-box)
and provides the scripts to create the xPack build environments
(either Docker images on GNU/Linux or separate folders on macOS).

## More info

- [Homepage](https://xpack.github.io/xbb/)
- [Prerequisites](https://xpack.github.io/xbb/prerequisites/)
- [End-of-life](https://xpack.github.io/xbb/end-of-life/)
- [Releases](https://xpack.github.io/xbb/releases/)

Starting with 2022, all builds will be performed with v3.4;
see the release page for details.

Except possible maintenance releases,
this is planned to be the final monolithic release; future releases
should be modular, and use binary xPacks on top of simple npm images.
