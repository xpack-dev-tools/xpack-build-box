# Script to build a Docker image with a bootstrap system, used to later build  
# the final xPack Build Box (xbb).
#
# Since the orginal CentOS 6 is too old to compile some of the modern
# sources, two steps are required. In the first step are compiled the most
# recent versions allowed by CentOS 6; being based on GCC 7.4, they should 
# be enough for a few years to come. With them, in the second step, are 
# compiled the very latest versions.

# Credits: Inspired by Holy Build Box build script.

# Note: the initial approach was to disable the creation of all shared 
# libraries and try to build everything as static. Unfortunately some
# of the tools are not able to do this correctly, and the final version
# was simplified to the defaults, which generally include both shared and
# static versions for the libraries. The drawback is that, in addition to 
# PATH, for the programs to start, the LD_LIBRARY_PATH must also be set 
# correctly.
